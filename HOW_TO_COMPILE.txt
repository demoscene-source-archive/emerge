This demo was made using the Code::Blocks IDE: http://www.codeblocks.org/

Compile it with GCC.

The Code::Blocks project file is "Emerge.cbp".

The following libraries are needed:
	SDL 1.2 https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
	DevIL http://openil.sourceforge.net/
	BASS https://www.un4seen.com/bass.html

Assimp is also required, but it is a custom hack of Assimp for which the source code has been lost.
The purpose of the custom hack was to fix the COLLADA loader so that it would load the COLLADA scene file correctly.

gl3w is included for loading OpenGL on Windows
